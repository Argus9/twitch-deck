    <h1>Welcome to the TwitchDeck Beta!</h1>
    <h3>What is TwitchDeck?</h3>
    <p>A web application that lets you watch multiple Twitch streams on the same page, at the same time. TwitchDeck
        displays a "primary" streamer in a larger player, with your other streamers displayed below in smaller players,
        with volume turned down by default.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>After entering your preferred priority of streamers, TwitchDeck will put the first online streamer in the main
        player, in the center of the screen, with the audio set to max. Next, TwitchDeck will place any remaining online
        streams, in order, in the subway bar under the main player with the volume turned off. Finally, offline streams
        will be placed behind them.</p>

    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
    <p>Enter the names of the streamers you'd like to watch, in order of priority. For instance:
        <b><%= ENV['CANONICAL_HOST'] || 'localhost:3000' %>
            /player/day9tv&covert_muffin&kinggothalion&professorbroman&riotgames</b> will display
        <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/day9tv">Day[9]</a>'s stream in the main player, the others in smaller streams
        below it. TwitchDeck will order the
        streams on-page first by whether they're online or offline, then by the priority you specify.</p>
    <p>In this example, once Day[9]'s stream goes offline, TwitchDeck will check the other streams, and if either
        are online, it will take the main stream over and move Day[9]'s stream to the deck.</p>
    <p>You can also register for a free account. This will let you store your favorite streamers and quickly load up
        TwitchDeck with those streamers without having to enter them into the address bar every time. You can re-order
        your preferred streamers in an easy-to-use UI in your profile page.</p>

    <h3>Do I have to pay to use TwitchDeck?</h3>
    <p>No! TwitchDeck is, and will always remain, free. I created TwitchDeck to give the Twitch community and myself a
        useful and fun tool to watch multiple streamers, and provide a better viewing experience through its automation
        features. If you'd like to support TwitchDeck, please tell your friends and other Twitch users about it. The
        sharing links in the player page are a great way to do this!</p>
